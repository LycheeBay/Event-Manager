# Event-Manager
API for verifying users and granting them access to event listings. This is built over the course of HackUTD 2022.

## Motivation
I was motivated by the State Farm challenge, to create a platform for community betterment.
I decide to create a database that allows users to retrieve events around them.
As my first experience with databases, I implement the two storages with different platforms, one with replit database, and another with sqlite.
